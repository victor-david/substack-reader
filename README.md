# Substack Reader

This browser extension enables you to change substack pages to either a light or dark theme,
overridng the stack author's selected theme.

I wrote this extension in order to be able to read certain substacks. Some are in dark colors which I can't handle.
Other people can't handle light colors. This extension lets you put stacks in either Light or Dark mode.

When this extension is installed, it automatcially is enabled for **[*.substack.com]**. When you click the extension's
icon, you can choose between light, dark, or off.

Some substacks use a custom domain. They're still substack under the hood. When you click the extension's icon
icon while on a site that is not **[*.substack.com]**, you can choose to register that site for use with the extension.

If you register a site for use with the extension, but it's not substack under the hood, the extension won't change
anything. It'll still inject the CSS, but it likely won't mean anything to the site.

## How It Works

This extension injects CSS into the site that causes the main parts of the substack theme to change.
It does not inject any Javascript.

As of October 2024, this extension is working, but is still in development.
