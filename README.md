# Substack Reader

This browser extension enables you to change substack pages to either a light or dark theme,
overridng the stack author's selected theme.

I wrote this extension in order to be able to read certain substacks. Some are in dark colors which I can't handle.
Other people can't handle light colors. This extension lets you put stacks in either Light or Dark mode.

As of October 2024, this extension is working, but is still in development.
