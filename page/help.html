                    This extension applies to domains and sub domains of <b>substack.com</b>,
                    and is used to override the theme set by the stack author.
                </div>
                <div>
                    When you click the extension icon, you can choose between the following:
                </div>
                <div>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Light</b> - Stacks are displayed in a light theme.</li>
                        <li><b>Dark</b> - Stacks are displayed in a dark theme.</li>
                        <li><b>Off</b> - Stacks are displayed in the original theme set by the stack author.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div>
                    A change applies to all sub domains of <b>substack.com</b>. When you make a change,
                    if one or more tabs are opened to a subtack, those tabs are reloaded to apply the new theme.
                </div>
                <h3>Other Domains</h3>
                <div>
                    When you click the extension icon while on a site that is not <b>substack.com</b>,
                    you have the option of adding that site to the sites that are affected by the extension.
                    This will only make a difference if the site is actually a substack, but is using a
                    <a href="https://support.substack.com/hc/en-us/articles/360051222571-How-do-I-set-up-my-custom-domain-on-Substack" target="_blank">substack custom domain</a>
                </div>
                <h3>Revoking Access</h3>
                <div>
                    When you click the extension icon on a site that you've added, you have the option of revoking that access.
